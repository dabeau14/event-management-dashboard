# event-management-dashboard
Welcome to the Event Management Dashboard, a simple Angular application designed for managing events. To get started, ensure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your machine. First, clone the repository from GitHub using the command git clone https://github.com/dabeau14/event-management-dashboard.git, and navigate into the project directory with cd event-management-dashboard. Next, install the necessary dependencies by running npm install. This application uses json-server to simulate a backend API, so youâ€™ll need to set up a mock server. Create a file named db.json in the root directory and populate it with your initial event data, such as title, date, location, and status. To enable the mock API, add the script "start:server": "json-server --watch db.json" to the scripts section of your package.json. Run the mock server by executing npm run start:server, which will host the API at http://localhost:3000/. After starting the mock server, run the Angular application with the command ng serve. This will launch the app in development mode, accessible at http://localhost:4200/. In the dashboard, you can add new events, view a list of existing events, and search for events by title. The app allows for easy deletion of events via a user-friendly interface. This project combines Angular for front-end functionality and Bootstrap for styling, providing a responsive user experience. Enjoy managing your events!
